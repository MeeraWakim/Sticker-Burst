> A Vue.js project

## Build Setup

``` bash
#git clone <repository link>

# install dependencies
npm install

# run project on localhost:8080
npm run dev

```
Once the npm run dev command runs, you should be able to explore and use our entire website on localhost:8080 (or whichever address your terminal says) in your browser of choice (preferably chrome) with no issues.

For detailed explanation on how things work, consult the [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
